Cool. Here’s a no-nonsense list of sections your boilerplate/scaffold generator README should have:

1. Project name and short description
2. Problem you’re solving / why it exists
3. Features
4. What it generates (Folder structure and key files)
5. Requirements
6. Installation instructions
7. Quick start example
9. Example outputs or sample projects
8. Available commands, flags, and options
10. Contributing guidelines
11. License
12. Roadmap (optional and only if you actually plan to build things)
13. FAQ (optional but useful)

If you want minimal make it down to 1–8. Anything beyond that is vanity.
